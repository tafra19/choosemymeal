                    Not being able to choose what to eat for the next meal is a struggle we all have at times. We're all a little indecisive at times, but have no fear, we've got you covered. With Choose My Meal you will be able to tell us what kind of meal you're looking for - breakfast, lunch, dinner, or dessert - and we will provide you with a random meal and the recipe for it. If you're up for some fun and adventure with your food, you've come to the right place!
