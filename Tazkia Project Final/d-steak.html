                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            	2 lbs NY strip steaks
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            	Â½ tbsp vegetable oil
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            	1.5 tsp sea salt
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            	1 tsp black pepper
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            	2 tbsp butter
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            	2 cloves garlic
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            	1 sprig fresh rosemary
                        </li>
                        
                    </ul>


                    <h4>
                        Directions:
                    </h4>
                  
                    <p>
                        Step 1: Heat the cast iron pan until hot then add 1/2 Tbsp oil over medium-high heat, swirling to coat. Once the oil is very hot, add salted steaks to the skillet. Sear the steaks on the first side for 4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then flip and cook another 3-4 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Step 2: Reduce heat to medium and immediately add 2 Tbsp butter, quartered garlic cloves and rosemary to the pan. Spoon the butter sauce over the steak, tilting the pan to get butter on your spoon. Continue spooning the sauce over the steak for a minute or until the steak is about 5-10 degrees from your desired doneness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Step 3: Transfer steak to a cutting board, loosely cover and rest 10 minutes before slicing into 1/2" strips to serve. Spoon extra butter sauce over sliced steak to serve.
